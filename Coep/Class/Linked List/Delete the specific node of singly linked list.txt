Algorithm to delete the specific node 
//This algorithm deletes the specific node. The element which you want to //delete that will be stored in num. 

Step 1: if head==NULL
           print "List is Empty"
           go to step 10
        [End of If]
Step 2: set temp=head
Step 3: set prev=temp
Step 4: Repeat steps 5 and 6 while temp->data!=num
Step 5:      set prev=temp
Step 6:      set temp=temp->next
	[End of loop]
Step 7: set ptr=temp
Step 8: prev->next=temp->next
Step 9: Free ptr
Step 10: Exit
