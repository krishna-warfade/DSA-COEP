Algorithm to delete the first node
Step 1: if head==NULL
           print "List is Empty"
           go to step 5
       [End of if]
Step 2: set temp=head
Step 3: set head=head->next
Step 4: Free temp
Step 5: Exit

Algorithm to delete the last node
Step 1: if head==NULL
           print "List is Empty"
           go to step 8
       [End of if]
Step 2: set temp=head
Step 3: Repeat steps 4 and 5 while temp->next!=NULL
Step 4:      set prev=temp
Step 5:      set temp=temp->next
	[End of loop]
Step 6: set prev->next=NULL
Step 7: Free temp
Step 8: Exit
