# DSA - COEP (Data Structures and Algorithms)

Welcome to the **DSA - COEP** repository! This project contains a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in C, tailored for the coursework and lab assignments at the **College of Engineering Pune (COEP)**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

### 1. `ADTs` (Abstract Data Types)
Contains implementations of fundamental data structures.
- **Linked List**: Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists.
- **Stack**: Array and Linked List based implementations.
- **Queue**: Simple, Circular, and Priority Queues.
- **Tree**: Binary Trees, BST, AVL Trees, etc.
- **Graph**: Graph representations and traversals (BFS, DFS).
- **Heap**: Min and Max Heaps.
- **Sparse Matrix**: Representations and operations.
- **ArrayADT**: Basic array operations.

### 2. `Algorithms`
Includes standard algorithms for solving common problems.
- **Sorting**: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap Sort, etc.
- **Searching**: Linear and Binary Search.
- **Hashing**: Hash tables and collision resolution techniques.

### 3. `Coep`
Specific resources related to the college curriculum.
- **Assignments**: Solutions to practical assignments.
- **LabWork**: Code written during lab sessions.
- **PYQs**: Previous Year Questions and solutions.
- **Class**: Classwork and examples.
- **Resources**: Additional learning materials.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any of the programs in this repository, you will need a C compiler (like `gcc`).

### Prerequisites
- GCC Compiler (MinGW for Windows, or native GCC for Linux/macOS)
- A code editor (VS Code, CLion, etc.)

### Compilation and Execution

1.  **Navigate to the directory** containing the source file:
    ```bash
    cd "path/to/directory"
    ```

2.  **Compile the C program**:
    ```bash
    gcc filename.c -o output_name
    ```

3.  **Run the executable**:
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      .\output_name.exe
      ```
    - On Linux/macOS:
      ```bash
      ./output_name
      ```

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Language**: C
- **Tools**: GCC, VS Code
